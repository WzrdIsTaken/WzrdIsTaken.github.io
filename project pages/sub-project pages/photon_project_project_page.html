							<h1>Photon Project | 31/10/20</h1>

							<!-- Summary -->
							<p>Towards the end of my 2020 summer hoilday I began working on a project using Photon (a networking solution). 
							   Right now the game is in a state where pretty much all the programming is done but due to university and a lack of motivation 
							   to get on with the all the artwork and level design that needs to be done in order to make this project a game rather than just a tech demo, 
							   progress has halted. I don't know if this project will ever get finished, but I do know that I learned so much while working on it that 
							   it was worth doing regardless. If I do get round to completing the game I will update this page, but until then I want at least a record of what I've done.</p>
							
							<!-- List Of Features -->
							<p>
								What follows is a list of all the key things that I developed for this game. If completed, it would be a 2D party arena shooter inspired by 
								<a href="https://raze.fandom.com/wiki/Raze_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raze 2</a>.
								<li>Public and private customisable rooms.</li>
								<li>Player manager and player controller networking structure.</li>
								<li>7 gamemodes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Elimination, Team Elimination, Capture The Flag, Domination and Juggernaut.</li>
								<li>UI, killfeed and Scoreboard.</li>
								<li>Player stats (eg: kills, deaths, etc).</li>
								<li>Full shop system.</li>
								<li>25 weapons, 8 abilities and 20 perks (and there relevant systems).</li>
								<li>Complete player character.</li>
								<li>Complete weapon system, including accuracy (recoil, movement, etc) and 7 different classifications of weapons (eg: explosive, sniper, etc).</li>
								<li>Saving / loading.</li>
								<li>Power ups.</li>
								<li>Weapon spawning system.</li>
								<li>And a bunch of stuff I'm sure I'm forgetting...</li>
							</p>
							
							<!-- Description -->
							<p>I think the majority of the code I wrote for this project was pretty good, though I would definitely do some things differently if I 
							   work on a Photon project again. My next step with networking is going to be working out how to use the Steam API, as my favourite types of 
							   games are co-op ones and Steam has a very nice way of implementing this.</p>
							<p>Doing this project has helped me a lot and has allowed me to solve problems such as spawning an object on the network but making it appear 
							   differently for different players and how to create a hierarchy of scriptable objects to efficiently add multiple custom objects such as weapons 
							   and perks - both for shop and in game use. This in turn has given me a base for implementing similar features in the future and has allowed me to 
							   gain a stronger understanding of how networking works and how to optimally use more of Unity's features.</p>
							<p>As I said at the start, I don't know if I will get round to finishing this project. However, I have no doubts that what I have learned while creating
						   	   it will assist me in the future. It also helps that it was pretty fun :).</p>
