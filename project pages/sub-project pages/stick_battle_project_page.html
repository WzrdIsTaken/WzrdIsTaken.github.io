							<h1>Stick Battle | 19/12/2019</h1>

							<!-- Summary -->
							<p>Stick Battle was my first large project in Unity. Before I'd mainly been doing tutorials and learning C#. 
							   Its basically a clone of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/674940/Stick_Fight_The_Game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stick Fight</a>, 
							   but with inspiration taken from one of my childhood favourite flash games - 
							   <a href="https://armorgames.com/play/5395/raze" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raze</a>.</p>

							<!-- Description -->
							<p>Stick Battle was, as well as being my first large project, my first attempt at doing something multiplayer - and even with UNET I found it quite difficult 
							   to understand where I was going wrong and hard to debug my code. Looking back, I should have definitely built up my networking experience with some 
							   smaller projects / tests before jumping right into a full game.</p>
							<p>On the plus side, creating Stick Battle really helped me refine my code. Looking at the first few scripts compared to the last ones, there is a clear positive difference. 
							   Furthermore, I became a lot more consistent and started to focus more on code maintainability, as Stick Battle (unlike my previous projects) wasn't a one and done kind of thing - 
							   I had to keep coming back to it for many months.</p>
							<p>Looking back, there are still many things that could be improved. If I had to make Stick Battle again, I'd definitely take a lot more time to plan and think about how my networking 
							   solution was going to work - this would have saved a lot of time.</p>
							<p>That all being said, I'm happy with Stick Battle's final state and I'm excited to work with multiplayer again in the future - especially if Unity updates their networking solution - 
							   as multiplayer games are my favourite.</p>
