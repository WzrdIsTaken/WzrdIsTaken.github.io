							<!-- Summary -->
							<p>Project ZipZap was created with an 11 person team in my final year of university. It is a fast paced, speedrunner friendly, hack n' dash, isometric game where the 
							   player must complete 5 levels including an explosive boss battle. I took a leading role in the project, applying what I had learned from my 
							   <a href="forza_horizon_5_project_page.html">placement year</a> to help ensure everything ran smoothly. After I finished university, I continued my leading role and worked
							   with a subset of the original team to add extra features and publish the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3093600/Project_ZipZap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>. 
							   Project ZipZap was nominated for the Creative Assembly: Best Game award.</p>

							<!-- Description -->
							<p>Code wise, in Project ZipZap I created many of the key underlying systems - for example audio, save/loading, leaderboards and stats/achievements. I also wrote player code, for example the 
							   explosive dash, and generally worked to fix bugs / polish gameplay elements all across the codebase.</p>
							   
							<p>The game was developed using an agile strategy with weekly playtests (both internal and external) conducted throughout. Project ZipZap runs on PC, PS5 and Steam Deck.</p>
