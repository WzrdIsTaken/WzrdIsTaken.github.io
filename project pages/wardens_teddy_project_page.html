							<!-- Summary -->
							<p>Made in Unity, Wardens Teddy was initially created for the 
							   <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2021/games/wardens-teddy-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 Global Game Jam</a> - 
							   but because we liked the concept so much, we pushed to polish the game and made it into a full release!</p>

							<!-- Description -->
							<p>The game is set in a prison, where you play as a warden who is locking up for the last time. But, then you realise that you've lost your teddy somewhere inside! 
							   Find keys to open the doors, dodge the traps meant for the escapees and find your teddy!</p>
						    <p>The original theme for the game jam was 'lost and found', and it was the first time I had ever worked in a team to create a game. Our team was made up of 5 people
							   (including me), and I took the role of programmer and unofficial project manager (aka the fun police, saying no to cool ideas to make sure the project got done...).
							   It was great to work with other talented people, especially those who enjoy art and level design!</p>
							<p>The game has 10 unique levels, a variety of traps and objectives, and an online highscore system! I am proud of both the GGJ and full game version, doubly so because 
							   it was my first full release game.</p>

							<p>Before Wardens Teddy, I had completed a number of other jams and created games such as 
							   <a href="sub-project pages/gravity_grapple_project_page.html">Gravity Grapple</a> and 
							   <a href="sub-project pages/the_hypnotist_and_the_diamond_rose_project_page.html">The Hypnotist and the Diamond Rose</a>, as well as made a variety of other small 
							   games, for example <a href="sub-project pages/stick_battle_project_page.html">Stick Battle</a>, 
							   <a href="sub-project pages/neon_dawn_project_page.html">Neon Dawn</a> and a project based around 
							   <a href="sub-project pages/photon_project_project_page.html">Photon</a> (a networking solution for Unity).
