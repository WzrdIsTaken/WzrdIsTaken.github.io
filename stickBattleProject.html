      <h1> Stick Battle | 19/12/19 </h1>
      <p> Stick Battle was my first large project in Unity. Before I'd mainly been doing tutorials and just learning C#. Its basically a clone of <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/674940/Stick_Fight_The_Game/">Stick Fight</a>, but with 
          inspiration taken from one of my childhood favourite flash games - <a target="_blank" href="https://armorgames.com/play/5395/raze">Raze</a>. </p>

      <p> Stick Battle was, as well as being my first large project, my first attempt at doing something multiplayer - and even with UNET I found it quite difficult to understand where I was going wrong and hard to debug my code. Looking back,
          I should of definitely built up my networking experience with some smaller projects / tests before jumping right into a full game. </p>
      <p> On the plus side, creating Stick Batte really helped me refine my code. Looking at the first few scripts compared to the last ones, their is a clear positive difference. Furthermore, I became a lot more 
          consistent and started to become a lot more focused on code maintainability, as Stick Battle (unlike my previous projects) wasn't a one and done kind of thing - I had to keep coming back 
          to it for many months. </p>
      <p> However looking back, their are still many things that could be improved. If I had to make Stick Battle again, I'd definitely take a lot more time to plan and think about how my networking
          solution was going to work - this would have saved a lot of time. </p>
      <p> That all being said, I'm happy with Stick Battle's final state and I'm excited to work with multiplayer again in the future - especially if Unity updates their networking solution - 
          as multiplayer games are my favourite. </p>
