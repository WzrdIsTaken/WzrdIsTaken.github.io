		<p> This is the full game version of Wardens Teddy! In my first year of university, I had a super long summer and wanted to spend some of it programming, so this is the project I chose. </p>
			
		<p> In this iteration, I did all of the programming while my friend Joseph did the majority of the art. With no other help, unfortunately some aspects of the game are a little less polished than I 
            would like - primarily player movement (which isn't great because in a platformer this is probably the most important thing). But due to me being not so great at actual game feel stuff and a fairly 
			tight deadline (I had jury service that summer) I just wanted to finish the game off. </p>
			
		<p> On the bright side, there is a lot I'm really happy with and this is the first time that I have ever taken a project from nothing to a full released game (discounting game jam games). Furthermore, I 
		    am happy with almost all of my code so that is always a good thing. </p>
			
		<p> You can download the game for free on itch or just check out the trailer above.</p>
