		<h1> Photon Project | 31/10/20 </h1>
      
		<p> Towards the end of my 2020 summer hoilday I began working on a project using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.photonengine.com/en/PUN">Photon</a> 
          (a networking solution). Right now the game is in a state where pretty much all the programming is done but due to university and a lack of motivation to get on
          with the all the artwork and level design that needs to be done in order to make this project a game rather than just a tech demo, progress has halted. I don't know
          if this project will ever get finished, but I do know that I learned so much while working on it that it was worth doing regardless. If I do get round to completing
          the game I will update this page, but until then I want at least a record of what I've done. </p>
          
		<p> --- </p>
      
	    <p> What follows is a list of all the key things that I developed for this game. If completed, it would be a 2D party arena shooter inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://raze.fandom.com/wiki/Raze_2">Raze 2</a>.</p>
		<ul>
			 <li> Public and private customisable rooms.
			 <li> Player manager and player controller networking structure.
			 <li> 7 gamemodes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Elimination, Team Elimination, Capture The Flag, Domination and Juggernaut.
			 <li> UI, killfeed and Scoreboard.
			 <li> Player stats (eg: kills, deaths, etc).
			 <li> Full shop system. 
			 <li> 25 weapons, 8 abilities and 20 perks (and there relevant systems).
			 <li> Complete player character.
			 <li> Complete weapon system, including accuracy (recoil, movement, etc) and 7 different classifications of weapons (eg: explosive, sniper, etc). 
			 <li> Saving / loading.
			 <li> Power ups.
			 <li> Weapon spawning system. 
			 <li> And a bunch of stuff I'm sure I'm forgetting...
		</ul>  
      
      <p> --- </p>
      
      <p> I think the majority of the code I wrote for this project was pretty good, though I would definitely do some things differently if I work on a Photon project again.
		  My next step with networking is going to be working out how to use the Steam API, as my favourite types of games are co-op ones and Steam has a very nice way
		  of implementing this. </p>
          
      <p> Doing this project has helped me a lot and has allowed me to solve problems such as spawning an object on the network but making it appear differently for different 
          players and how to create a hierarchy of scriptable objects to efficiently add multiple custom objects such as weapons and perks - both for shop and in game use. 
          This in turn has given me a base for implementing similar features in the future and has allowed me to gain a stronger understanding of how networking works and how
          to optimally use more of Unity's features. </p>
       
      <p> As I said at the start, I don't know if I will get round to finishing this project. However, I have no doubts that what I have learned while creating it will assist
          me in the future. It also helps that it was pretty fun :). </p>
