        <p> The Wardens Teddy was made in about 24 hours for the 2021 Global Game Jam (the theme being 'lost and found') and was the first time I have ever worked on a team for something game dev wise. </p>

		<p> The game is set in a prison, where you play as a warden who is locking up for the last time. But, then you realise that you've lost your teddy somewhere inside! Find keys to open the doors,
		dodge the traps meant for the escapees and find your teddy! </p> 

		<p> I took the role of programmer and unofficial project manager. It was so nice to work with other talented people - especially artists and those who enjoy level design :D. I am definitely looking
		forward to working with these guys in the future. </p> 

		<p> The game has a live world record / time system to add repeatability (a very scuffed system that I coded in like 20 mins at the start of the project and I'm shocked hasn't broken yet...), 
		a number of traps and 10 unique levels. </p>
