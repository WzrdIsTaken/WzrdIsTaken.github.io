	  <p> Hi! </p>
      <p> I'm Ben, a 19 year old Game Developer currently in my second year towards my degree in BSc (Hons) Games Technology at the University of the West of England. </p>
	  <p> I have created a number of games and applications using various tools and languages, with my most recent project being 
	      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uol5da4TVY0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wardens Teddy</a> - a 2D platformer where you have to work back through the prison you
		  once patrolled to rescue your lost friend, all while dodging traps and solving the puzzles meant for the escapees! </p>
	  <p></p>
	  <p> Since secondary school I have been interested in computer science and creating games, the discipline allowing for both creativity and problem solving with the result being 
	      something that can actually give others a meaningful experience. Some of my favorite games include Subnautica, The Forest and Terraria. I love multiplayer survival games that
          give you the freedom to do what you like, while also having an attainable end goal. </p>
	  <p></p>
	  <p> Outside of programming and playing games, I enjoy reading, exercise and the outdoors. Recently I have begun learning Korean and have so far reached an intermediate level. </p>
