							<p>Hi!</p>
							<p>I'm Ben, an undergraduate Gameplay Engineer with a year's industry experience at 
							   <a href="project pages/forza_horizon_5_project_page.html">Playground Games</a>
							   using C++ & C# to develop Forza Horizon 5. The primary features I worked on were
							   automated player emulation testing using 
							   <a href="https://youtu.be/FCGUzFeHcr4?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BotBrain</a>,
							   the
							   <a href="https://youtu.be/zpAXUogmc50" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rally Adventure</a> DLC
							   and 
							   <a href="https://youtu.be/HRdxjafYSAo?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Event Lab 2.0</a>.</p>
							<p>I am set to graduate from the University of the West of England in 2024 with a Games Technology BSc (Hons). Here I 
							   completed solo and group projects using C++, C#, Unity and Unreal and my first class working grade
							   has been recognised by inclusion on the Deanâ€™s list.</p>
							<p>To further develop my skills I have also undertaken personal projects including a 
							   <a href="project pages/nabi_project_page.html">custom C++ game engine</a> 
							   with DirectX and an Entity Component System, and created my own full release game
							   "<a href="project pages/wardens_teddy_project_page.html">Wardens Teddy</a>". For my dissertation I am building a 
							    <a href="project pages/nabi_allocator_project_page.html">C++ memory allocator</a>, and my other final year projects include a VR game using Unity.</p>
							<p>Since secondary school I have been interested in computer science and creating games, the discipline allowing for both creativity and problem solving with the 
							   result being something that can actually give others a meaningful experience. Some of my favorite games include Subnautica, The Forest, Minecraft and Terraria. 
							   I love multiplayer survival games that give you the freedom to do what you like, whilst also having a challenging but attainable end goal.</p>
							<p>Outside of programming I enjoy running, climbing, reading and of course playing games! I'm also learning Korean and have so far reached an intermediate level.</p>
							<p>I'm currently looking to continue my career in the games industry as a Gameplay Engineer.</p>
