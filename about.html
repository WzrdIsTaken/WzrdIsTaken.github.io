							<p>Hi!</p>
							<p>I'm Ben, a Gameplay Engineer currently working at <a href="https://playground-games.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Playground Games</a> primarily using C++ to develop 
							   <a href="project pages/forza_horizon_6_project_page.html">Forza Horizon 6</a>.
							   Prior to my current role, I also completed a placement year at Playground Games where I contributed to 
							   <a href="project pages/forza_horizon_5_project_page.html">Forza Horizon 5</a> and its Rally Adventure DLC. 
							<p>I graduated from the University of the West of England in 2024 with a <a href="https://wzrdistaken.github.io/images/certificates/university_graduation_certificate.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Class</a>
   							   in Games Technology BSc (Hons). Here I completed solo and group projects using C++, C#, Unity and Unreal. My working grade
							   was recognised by inclusion on the Deanâ€™s list and nominations for the "Outstanding Graduate of the Year: Programmer" & 
							   "<a href="https://tiga.org/news/tiga-uk-games-education-awards-2024-watch-the-virtual-ceremony-on-friday-october-11th-4pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creative Assembly: Best Game</a>" awards.</p>
							<p>To further develop my skills I have undertaken personal projects including a 
							   <a href="project pages/nabi_project_page.html">custom C++ game engine</a>, and released a game on Steam - <a href="project pages/project_zipzap_project_page.html">Project ZipZap</a>.
							     For my dissertation I built a <a href="project pages/nabi_allocator_project_page.html">C++ memory allocator</a>.
							<p>Since secondary school I have been interested in computer science and creating games, the discipline allowing for both creativity and problem solving with the 
							   result being something that can give others a meaningful experience. Some of my favorite games include Subnautica, The Forest, and Terraria. 
							   I love multiplayer survival games that give you the freedom to do what you like, whilst also having a challenging but attainable end goal.</p>
							<p>Outside of programming I enjoy climbing, reading, running and of course playing games! I'm also learning Korean and have so far reached an intermediate level.</p>
